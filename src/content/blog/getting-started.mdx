## Adding Content

To add a new blog post, create a new MDX file in the `src/content/blog` directory. The file should have a frontmatter section with the following fields:

---
title: 'Your Post Title'

## Customizing the Theme

You can customize the theme by editing the `tailwind.config.ts` file. The template uses Tailwind CSS, so you can easily change colors, typography, and more.
